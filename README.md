Setup: The general format of the program has been set up with the possibilities of drawing four different symbols. Additional symbols can be added at users’ discretion. 

Meaningfulness: This system is meaningful to me as it makes automatic painting in Python possible. The shape, color and number of symbols are unpredictable as their occurrences depends on the Markov Chain. The program has the possibility to generate more complicated graphs. I like symbols because even though they look symbol, they have plenty of mathematical properties to explore and are the foundations of physical structures. 

Challenges: I pushed myself outside my comfort zone by writing my first OOP in Python after a year (from the intro class) … I also refreshed on the turtle module and became more skillful at creating symbols. This is an important challenge for me as I need to plan on the exact way to produce visual arts in Python using Markov Chain. Going forward, I am hoping to use Markov Chain to select pixels from existing artworks and recreate them. 

Creativity: I believe my program is creative in terms of reassembling the symbols and making potentially appealing abstract artworks. But it is still not creative enough as it’s governed by the given form of symbols and so is lacking flexibility.
